# node-ts-template

A template project for developing node.js (this project was last tested with v20.12.0) projects with Typescript. Configured with ESLint and Prettier for linting and formatting. Example Typescript files can be found in the `/src` directory.

## Getting started

-   Open the project in VS Code, you should be prompted to install the recommended extensions (Prettier and ESLint). If you this doesn't appear open the command pallet `ctrl + shift + p` and type `Show Recommended Extensions` to install the extensions. It's recommended to also change your VS Code settings to configure Prettier to format file on save.
-   Run `npm install` in in the terminal to install dependencies

### To run the script with hot reloading:

-   Run `npm run dev`
